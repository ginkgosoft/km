# Electronic Signature

An electronic signature is a digital representation of a person's signature that is used to sign documents in electronic form. It serves as a secure and legally recognized method of authentication, eliminating the need for physical signatures on paper. Electronic signatures offer benefits such as time and cost savings, remote signing capabilities, enhanced security features, and widespread acceptance in many countries. They are created using cryptographic techniques to ensure integrity and can be implemented through technologies like PKI, digital certificates, and encryption algorithms. Overall, electronic signatures provide a convenient and reliable way to sign documents electronically while maintaining legal validity.
