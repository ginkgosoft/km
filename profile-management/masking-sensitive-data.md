# Masking sensitive data

You can control the display of sensitive information, such as the Buyer's name, email, and phone number, by accessing the "Masking Sensitive Data" option in their Profile menu. Enabling this feature will mask certain parts of the name, email, and phone number displayed in the system. All screens that show this information will be affected by this setting.
